%% Solar Pumping Microgrid - Description and Overview
% 
% This microgrid project includes non-grid supplied power systems for 
% domestic water supply and electrical lighting serving a small community
% in Uganda.
% 
% In Uganda clean, potable water is often attained from vertical boreholes 
% where aquifers are available. Hand pump kiosks allow for manual extraction of 
% water but this is not effective for larger communities where
% community members face long wait times (figure 1).

% 
% This microgrid project develops electric power to pump domestic water
% from a borehole to a water storage tank. Figure 2 shows a general solar 
% pumping diagram.

% 
% Microgrid design permaeters for our community are based on an 
% Engineering Without Borders 2020 implementation report by the Penn State 
% University chapter of Engineers Without Borders. The chapter worked with 
% the community of Namutamba for several years to understand design requirements 
% such as daily water volume requirements and water storage. 
% 
% Water storage is required for buffering against cloudy days when the microgrid 
% power source for water pumping is not available.
% 
% This microgrid project includes electrical power and electrical storage 
% requirements to serve a small school house. Electrical stroage is required 
% for inclement weather where daily power resources fall below average. 
% 
% Microgrid projects (non-grid tied) with similar designs are
% implemented by Engineers Without Borders chapters in a number of African
% countries. Figure 3 shows solar projects in Uganda and Kenya where each 
% colored circle indicates a solar installation. Reasons for solar 
% adoption are solar can be more reliable than grid power, less expensive 
% than grid power, and solar can be erected where needed.

% Satellite images (figure 4) show large open areas that favor solar 
% installation sites. The community is low density with few structurs and land 
% use includes agriculture. The Pen State University chapter has completed
% reports describing the demographic and socioeconomic profiles for
% the community.
